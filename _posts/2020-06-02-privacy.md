Elytra is built to protect your privacy. I do not collect any personal information from you when you sign up or during your use of the service. You can read Elytra's Privacy Policy [here](https://elytra.app/privacy) which goes into the legalese of things. 

Elytra's API Service further protects your privacy by removing all known tracking scripts embeded in articles in the form of scripts and images. This ensures a seamless, private environment for you to read your favourite blogs in. 

The service doesn't aggregate any infromation about you either. As your account is anonymous, no data is available to share with 3rd Parties and advertisers, which means I can proudly tell them to go elsewhere. :]
