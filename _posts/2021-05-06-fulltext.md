description: Fulltext extraction of articles. 
---

Elytra supports extracting full-text articles from most websites. Some websites are structured in odd ways which causes this to fail sometimes. 

If you report such an issue to me, I can try to fix things so that everything works as expected. 

In such a case, your devices store a local copy of both the standard article and the full-text extract. 

You can remove your local full-text cache by:

1. Navigating to the article which you want to reload. 

2. Long tap on the full-text button to bring up a context menu. (Right click on macOS)

3. Select the `Delete Full Text Copy` option. 

You may have to repeat the steps if you still see the full-text icon highlighted in in your preferred tint colour.
