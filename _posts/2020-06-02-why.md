## What is Elytra
Elytra is an RSS Feed Reader with an iOS & iPadOS and Web Interface. You can find the iOS App [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elytra/id1433266971?ls=1&mt=8) and the web app [here](https://elytra.app/u/feeds).

## Why I created Elytra
A lot of very good RSS Feed Aggregation services existed when I was looking for one back in 2018. However, all of them collected a lot of personally identifying information from me as well as lot of analytics scripts collecting information in the background about articles I read and blogs I subscribe to. 

Another big problem was a lot of iOS Apps dumped the HTML into a Web View to render the article. This caused some tracking scripts embeded by publishers to trigger and get continue to get information even if the app itself didn't. 

I did not want any of that, so I set out to create my own. Elytra was created a primary focus on **Accessibility** and **Privacy**. Before *Sign in with Apple* debuted, I had to create my own private ID mechanism that worked without collecting any personal information from you. 

## Who I am 
Hi, my name is Nikhil Nigade, you can find me on my [Micro.blog](https://dezinezync.com/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dezinezync). I designed and engineered Elytra's iOS App, Web App and Server Side services. I am dsylexic and I made Elytra to inculcate better reading habits in me. Seeing how it shaped up, I most certainly wanted to share it with the world.
