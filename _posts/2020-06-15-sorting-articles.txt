Elytra has 4 sorting options to choose from, where sorting is done by the published date of the article:  

1. All - Descending (Newest First, Default)
2. All - Ascendeing (Oldest First)
3. Unread - Descending
4. Unread - Ascending

For the Unread section of the apps, the 1. and 2. options behave like 3. and 4. 

Your selected option is applied by default the next time you open a feed. 

When searching, this option is ignored and articles are always listed in Descending Order.
