Elytra for Web brings the "Context Menu" Paradigm to the Web App. For instance, all Feeds & Folders in the navigation support show their respective context menus. 

Right clicking on a feed brings up its context menu with options respective to that feed.

Similarly, right clicking on a folder will show options respective to that folder. 

Currently, the following objects render a Context Menu:
- Feed
- Folder
- Article
- Paragraphs
- Images
