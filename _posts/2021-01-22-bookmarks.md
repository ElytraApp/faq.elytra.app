Bookmarks in Elytra are great for referencing articles later, or for saving them to read later. 

### iOS and macOS  

There are multiple ways to bookmark an article in iOS and macOS. You can bookmark an article by: 

- long tapping on an article to bring up its context menu, then tapping Bookmark. 

- in the Article interface, tapping bookmark in the toolbar (on iOS only). 

- swiping left on an article to reveal the swipe actions.

You can optionally hide the Bookmarks listing in the Feeds Interface by toggling the option under Settings > Miscellaneous.
