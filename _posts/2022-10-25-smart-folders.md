## Smart Folders

Smart Folders are a common pattern on macOS to categorise articles, posts, emails, etc. following some common rules, automatically managed for you. 

Smart Folders in Elytra work similarly. You create a new smart folder and define rules, optionally choosing to receiving notifications when articles matching those rules become available. 

### Prerequisites 

To be able to create a Smart Folder, you must have at-least one folder with at-least one feed in it. 

If you don't see the option to create a smart folder after creating a new folder with a feed in it, restarting the app will fix this issue. 

#### iOS 

- In the iOS app, long tap on the `+` button to bring up the menu to create a **New Smart Folder**. 

- On iPadOS, you can use the same long tap gesture as iPhones, and alternately, the <kbd>⌥ + ⌘ + n</kbd> key combination from a connected keyboard. 

#### macOS 

You can create a **New Smart Folder** from:
- The File Menu > New Smart Folder 
- Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>⌥ + ⌘ + n</kbd>
- The New Button in the toolbar
