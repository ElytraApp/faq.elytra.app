description: Reload an incorrectly formatted/recently updated article from the Elytra API.

Sometimes, an article may be incorrectly formatted or not appearing correctly. If you report such an article to me, I may update but your devices will still show you the cached local copy. 

Previously, you'd have to do a full-resync to work around this. 

Starting from v2.3, you can follow these steps to reload an article:

1. Open the article.

2. Long tap on the title to bring up a context menu. 

3. Tap/click on the Reload Article menu item to initiate the download. 

If the article was updated since your device cached it, it'll now be updated and synced on that device. 

Note: This is per device and will not sync across your devices.
